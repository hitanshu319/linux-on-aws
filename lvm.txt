First create a new volume or HDD of any size lets say 2 GB then attach it to your AWS instance .
Now connect to AWS instance .
Now creating a partition in HDD 
Step 1 --- PARTITION
run a command --- 
lsblk [This command will show all the HDD ]
fdisk -l [This command will show external HDD]
To create a partition run commannd 
fdisk hdd name 
Ex-   fdisk /dev/xvdf
To make new partition 
press n
Press enter 3 times for default settings and at 4th step specify size of partition 
as +400M 
Press p or print to get info about partition
To save partition press wq and enter
 
Step 2----  FORMAT the HDD
It means creating a hdd for storing info 
NTFS(format of windows),HFS+(mac),XFS(linux)          (FAT,VFAT{formats accessible to all os})
for formatting a HDD
mkfs.xfs disk name
mkfs.xfs /dev/xvdf1

to check which formats are supoorted for formatting 
mkfs.(double tab) 

Step3 ------ Mounting a HDD
Mounting is the attaching of an additional filesystem to the currently accessible filesystem of a computer. 
A filesystem is a hierarchy of directories (also referred to as a directory tree) that is used to organize files on a computer 
or storage media (e.g., a CDROM or floppy disk)

First make dir in which we have to mount the HDD 
mkdir /mnt/newvolume
now Mount the HDD
mount   /dev/xvdf1    /mnt/newvolume
this will mount the HDD into newvolume dir
To get the dir or place where the HDD is mounted 
df -hT

This mounting of HDD is one time process or its an temporary process so when we rebbot the instance we have to mount the HDD 
again and have to repeat the mounting process again but only mounting process.

To save the mounting permanently 
vim /etc/fstab 
write 
HDD name and mounted place and add xfs  
/dev/xvdf1  /mnt/newvolume  xfs
:wq

now mount -a 

this will save mount permanently
