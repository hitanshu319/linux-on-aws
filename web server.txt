Web Server
WEb server has two types 
1. apache(most popular open source , free) 
2. httpd
To run our website or any HTML page we use Apache2 in  ubuntu and httpd in redhat.

Lcal or free ip provider -----
Wamp, Lamp, Mamp and Xampp are local servers that are used while developing PHP sites.
Using these servers, programmers can test a website locally before they upload it to the main server. 
This ensures that the new website doesn’t have any bugs or errors.

    Lamp is for Linux.

    Wamp is for Windows.

    Mamp is for Mac OS X.

    Xampp is  for x-os, apache, mysql, php , perl.

NGINX --- first server 
Apache runs on all kinds of Unix-like systems (e.g., Linux or BSD) and has full support for Microsoft Windows. 
NGINX also runs on several modern Unix-like systems and has some support for Windows, 
but its Windows performance is not as strong as that of other platforms.

.ITS is best for .net users
apache tomcat is java most powerfull streaming server.
